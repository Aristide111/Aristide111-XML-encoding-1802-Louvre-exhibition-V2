# The Louvre exhibition project-V2

During the Second French War against Italy, which took place between 1799 and 1801, the French army seized numerous Italian works of art. In 1802, the Louvre Museum organized an art exhibition showcasing the most significant pieces acquired during this campaign. The exhibition quickly gained widespread popularity and provoked a variety of reactions in the contemporary press. Many of these press reviews are now archived at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF). For our project, we have selected one review. Specifically, we will focus on encoding the reactions found in the review titled Journal du Publiciste.

This project has two primary objectives:

1. **Contextual Metadata Creation**

We have generated extensive metadata to better understand the context in which the transcription and encoding of the text were produced. This includes information about the publication, authorship, and historical circumstances surrounding the review.

2. **Encoding Artistic Works and Artists**

We will encode the names of the art pieces and their respective artists that were displayed in the exhibition. This will allow us to trace the mobility and provenance of the works, as well as to study the influence and importance of the Louvre Museum within the artistic life of Paris.

XML proves to be an extremely useful tool for this project, as it enables us to create structured keys such as names, places, and art pieces, facilitating both the encoding process and the subsequent analysis of the exhibition and its reception
